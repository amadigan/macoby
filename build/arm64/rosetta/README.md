# Linux Kernel Rosetta Patches

Apple has a small patch for the Linux kernel that improves the performance of Rosetta, for full details see 
[Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/accelerating-the-performance-of-rosetta).
The patch provided by Apple does not apply cleanly to linux 6.11+. This directory contains a regenerated patch for kernel 6.12.11.

Apple's license for the original patch applies, and is included in this directory (and in the patch itself).
